# TKT-002: Remove top-right header bar items and relocate to sidenav

## Summary
Remove all items from the top-right header bar (Calendar dropdown, Find box, bell/notifications icon, user avatar) and relocate key functionality to the sidenav.

## Current State
The top-right header bar currently contains:
- Calendar dropdown
- Find search box
- Bell (notifications) icon
- User avatar

## Requirements

### Remove from header bar
- Remove all items from the top-right header area
- Keep the underlying components/modals that these items trigger - just remove the header bar UI

### Relocate Find functionality
- The "Find" item in the sidenav should trigger the same search modal/functionality that currently opens when clicking the Find box in the top-right header

### Relocate notifications bell
- Add the bell/notifications button to the bottom of the sidenav
- Position it to the right of the user row

## Notes
- This is a UI reorganization to consolidate navigation into the sidenav
- No functionality should be lost, only relocated
