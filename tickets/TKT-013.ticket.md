# TKT-013: Upgrade lucide-react from 0.544.0 to 0.562.0

## Problem
tisket-app uses lucide-react 0.544.0 while tisket uses 0.562.0.

Newer versions may have:
- Additional icons
- Bug fixes
- Improved tree-shaking

## Solution
```bash
npm install lucide-react@0.562.0
```

Check for any removed/renamed icons after upgrade.

> Upgraded lucide-react from 0.544.0 to 0.562.0 in package.json. No breaking changes, all icon imports continue to work.
