# TKT-018: Add employer setup flow for new users

When a user logs in without an employer, they currently see a dead-end message: "Welcome to Tisket - You don't have an employer set up yet. Please contact your administrator."

**Required:**
Replace this with a proper onboarding/setup flow that allows users to create their employer.

**Design inspiration (from Mobbin):**
- Split layout: form on left, imagery/branding on right
- Step-by-step wizard flow
- Clean, professional look similar to Airwallex or Remote's signup flows

**Flow should include:**
- Company/employer basic info collection
- Any required setup steps to get started with the app

**Current state:**
Just a static message with no action available - users are stuck.
