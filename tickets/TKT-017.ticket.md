# TKT-017: Simplify breadcrumb to use URL as reference

Refactor the breadcrumb component to derive its structure directly from the URL path.

**Requirements:**
- Each breadcrumb segment should link to its corresponding URL path
- On click/press, navigate to the relevant address
- Simplify the logic - no need for complex state or context management

**Style reference:**
- Use the breadcrumb styling from `/Users/jim/Projects/tisket/web` as a reference

**Notes:**
- This is a simplification effort - the current implementation may be over-engineered
- URL-based breadcrumbs are more predictable and easier to maintain
