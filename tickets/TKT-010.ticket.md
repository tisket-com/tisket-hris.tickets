# TKT-010: Upgrade tRPC from 11.3.1 to 11.8.1 to match tisket

## Problem
tisket-app uses tRPC 11.3.1 while tisket uses 11.8.1.

Version alignment ensures:
- Consistent API patterns
- Shared learnings between projects
- Easier code sharing

## Solution
```bash
npm install @trpc/next@11.8.1 @trpc/react-query@11.8.1 @trpc/server@11.8.1
```

Test all tRPC endpoints after upgrade.

> Created shared PayElementFormSheet component and usePayElementRouter hook. Added missing delete functionality to salary-sacrifice and pensions update components. All 8 pay element types now follow consistent patterns.
