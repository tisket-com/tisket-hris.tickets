# TKT-005: Unify 8 pay element form types into single configurable component

## Problem
There are 8 separate form implementations for pay elements:
- Benefits
- Deductions
- Earnings
- Orders
- Pensions
- Reimbursements
- Salary Sacrifice
- Statutory Pay

All follow the same pattern with type-specific field differences.

## Solution
Create a unified `<PayElementForm>` component with:
- Discriminated union Zod schema for type-specific validation
- Conditional field rendering based on element type
- Shared field components for common fields

## Impact
8 form implementations → 1 configurable component with type configs.
