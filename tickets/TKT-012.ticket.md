# TKT-012: Upgrade @tanstack/react-query from 5.80.6 to 5.90.16

## Problem
tisket-app uses @tanstack/react-query 5.80.6 while tisket uses 5.90.16.

Keeping versions aligned ensures consistent data fetching behavior.

## Solution
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query@5.90.16
```

Test query caching and mutation behavior after upgrade.
