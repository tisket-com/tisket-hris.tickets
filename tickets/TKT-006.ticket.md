# TKT-006: Extract generic EntitySelector component from 4 selector implementations

## Problem
There are 4 similar selector components with duplicated logic:
- org-selector.tsx (embedded in app-sidebar, 1400+ LOC)
- paygroup-selector.tsx
- payrun-selector.tsx
- employee-selector.tsx

All implement dropdown/command-based selection with similar patterns.

## Solution
Create a generic `<EntitySelector>` component that accepts:
- Data fetching hook
- Display formatters
- Selection callbacks
- Search/filter configuration

## Impact
Consolidate selector logic, reduce code duplication, improve consistency.
