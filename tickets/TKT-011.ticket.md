# TKT-011: Upgrade Zod from 3.25 to 4.3 to match tisket

## Problem
tisket-app uses Zod 3.25.61 while tisket uses Zod 4.3.5.

This is a major version difference that could affect:
- Schema definition syntax
- Error handling
- Type inference

## Solution
1. Review Zod 4 migration guide
2. Update all schema definitions if needed
3. Test form validation thoroughly

```bash
npm install zod@4.3.5
```

## Note
This may require schema syntax updates - Zod 4 has breaking changes.

> BLOCKED: AI SDK requires Zod ^3.0.0. Cannot upgrade until @ai-sdk/openai, @ai-sdk/react, and ai packages support Zod 4.

> Added showPagination prop to DataTable, created TableActions and TableHeader components. Updated earnings and deductions tables as examples. Remaining tables can be migrated incrementally.
