# TKT-007: Refactor app-sidebar.tsx - split 462 LOC monolithic file

## Problem
`/components/sidebar/app-sidebar.tsx` is 462 lines and contains:
- Multiple inline components
- Org selector logic
- Navigation rendering
- State management

This violates single responsibility and makes maintenance difficult.

## Solution
Split into:
- `app-sidebar.tsx` - Main layout only
- `nav-main.tsx` - Navigation items
- `org-selector.tsx` - Organization selection (extract from inline)
- `sidebar-state.ts` - State management hooks

## Reference
The tisket project has cleaner sidebar organization to follow.

> Split app-sidebar.tsx into: sidebar-context.tsx, org-selector.tsx, nav-main.tsx, user-section.tsx, search-bar.tsx. Main file reduced from 462 to 115 lines.
